### Noise Covariance Matrix

1. **Definition**:
   - The noise covariance matrix represents the statistical properties of the noise in the EEG data. It quantifies how noise varies across different channels and how noise in one channel is correlated with noise in other channels.

2. **Purpose**:
   - **Improving Source Localization**: By accurately modeling the noise, the inverse solution (which maps EEG data from the sensor space to the source space) can be more precise. This helps in distinguishing true brain activity from noise.
   - **Regularization**: The noise covariance matrix is used in regularizing the inverse problem, which is inherently ill-posed. Regularization helps in obtaining stable and meaningful solutions.

3. **Computation**:
   - The noise covariance matrix is typically computed from segments of the EEG data that are assumed to contain only noise (e.g., pre-stimulus baseline periods or resting-state data).
   - In practice, methods like empirical covariance or shrinkage methods are used to estimate the noise covariance matrix from the data.

### Steps in MNE

1. **Epoching**:
   - The continuous EEG data is divided into epochs (short segments of data). This helps in isolating periods of interest and computing the noise covariance from these segments.

2. **Covariance Estimation**:
   - The noise covariance matrix is estimated from the epochs. This involves calculating the covariance of the EEG signals across different channels during the noise periods.

### Example in Code

In the provided code, the noise covariance matrix is computed using the `compute_covariance` function from the MNE package:

```python
# 1. Equally-spaced epochs
epochs = make_fixed_length_epochs(raw, duration=epoch_duration, preload=False)

# 2. Noise covariance
noise_cov = compute_covariance(epochs, tmax=0., method=['shrunk', 'empirical'], rank=None, verbose=True)
```

- **`make_fixed_length_epochs`**: This function creates epochs of fixed length from the raw EEG data.
- **`compute_covariance`**: This function computes the noise covariance matrix from the epochs. The `tmax=0.` parameter indicates that the covariance is computed from the baseline period (pre-stimulus). The `method` parameter specifies the estimation methods used (e.g., 'shrunk' and 'empirical').

By accurately estimating the noise covariance matrix, the subsequent steps in source localization (like computing the inverse operator) can be performed more effectively, leading to better identification of brain activity sources.
