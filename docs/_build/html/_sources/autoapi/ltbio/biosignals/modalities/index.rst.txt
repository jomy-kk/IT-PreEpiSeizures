   It may be associated with a source, a patient, and a body location. It can also have a name.
   It has an initial and final datetime. Its length is its number of channels.
   It can be resampled, filtered, and concatenated to other Biosignals.
   Amplitude and spectrum plots can be displayed and saved.

   .. py:method:: r_timepoints(algorithm='hamilton', _by_segment=False) -> tuple

      Finds the timepoints of the R peaks.

      @param algoritm (optional): The algorithm used to compute the R peaks. Default: Hamilton segmenter.
      @param _by_segment (optional): Return timepoints grouped by uninterrptuned segments.

   .. py:method:: heartbeats(before=0.2, after=0.4)

      Segment the signal by heartbeats.
      Works like a Segmenter, except output Timeseries is not necessarily equally segmented.

      Parameters
      ----------
      before : float, optional
          Window size to include before the R peak (seconds).
      after : int, optional
          Window size to include after the R peak (seconds).

      Returns
      ----------
      heartbeats : ECG
          Biosignal segmented where each Segment is a heartbeat.

      Note
      ----------
      If filtered, the raw samples are not recoverable by 'undo_filters'.


   .. py:method:: hr(smooth_length: float = None)

      Transform ECG signal to instantaneous heart rate.

      Parameters
      ----------
      smooth_length : float, optional
          Length of smoothing window. If not given, no smoothing is performed on the instantaneous heart rate.

      Returns
      -------
      hr : HR

      Interpolation is used.
      It is assumed the ECG only has one channel.

      Returns
      -------
      nni : ECG
          Pseudo-Biosignal where each sample is the interval of the R peak 'occured there' and the previous R peak.


   .. py:method:: invert_if_necessary()

      Investigates which ECG channels need to be inverted, and, the ones that do, get inverted just like method 'invert'.
      Based on the median of the R-peaks amplitudes. Works preferably with leads I and II.

      Parameters
      ----------
      None

      Returns
      -------
      None


   .. py:method:: skewness(by_segment: bool = False) -> dict[str:float | list[float]]

      Computes the skweness of each channel.

      otherwise the weighted average is returned. Weighted by duration of each segment.

      If kurtosis <= 5, it means there's a great amount of noise present.

      :return: A dictionary of kurtosis value(s) for each channel.


   .. py:method:: flatline_percentage(by_segment: bool = False)

      Computes the % of flatline of each channel.

      If `by_segment` is True, a list of values is returned for each contiguous uninterrupted segment,
      otherwise the weighted average is returned. Weighted by duration of each segment.

      Adequate to evaluate the presence of baseline drift.
      Values between [0.95, 1] mean ECG shows optimal quality.

      :return: A dictionary of the computed ratio for each channel.

      Meant to evaluate the presence of baseline wander.
      Ref: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260714003241?via%3Dihub#bib0040

      :return: A dictionary of the computed ratio for each channel.


   .. py:method:: pSQI(by_segment: bool = False)

      Computes the ration between [5, 15] Hz and [5, 40] Hz frequency power bands.
      If `by_segment` is True, a list of values is returned for each contiguous uninterrupted segment,
      otherwise the weighted average is returned. Weighted by duration of each segment.

      Values between [0.5, 0.8] mean QRS complexes show high quality.

      :return: A dictionary of the computed ratio for each channel.


   .. py:method:: qSQI(by_segment: bool = False)

      Evaluates agreement between two R detectors.
      If `by_segment` is True, a list of values is returned for each contiguous uninterrupted segment,

      Values > 90% mean optimal R-peak consensus.
