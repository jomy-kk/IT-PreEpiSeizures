   A Biosignal is a set of Timeseries, called channels, of samples measuring a biological variable.
   It may be associated with a source, a patient, and a body location. It can also have a name.
   It has an initial and final datetime. Its length is its number of channels.
   It can be resampled, filtered, and concatenated to other Biosignals.
   Amplitude and spectrum plots can be displayed and saved.
