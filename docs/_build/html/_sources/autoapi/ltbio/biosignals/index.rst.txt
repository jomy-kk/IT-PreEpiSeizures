   .. autoapi-inheritance-diagram:: ltbio.biosignals.Biosignal
      :parts: 1

   A Biosignal is a set of Timeseries, called channels, of samples measuring a biological variable.
   It may be associated with a source, a patient, and a body location. It can also have a name.
   It has an initial and final datetime. Its length is its number of channels.
   It can be resampled, filtered, and concatenated to other Biosignals.
   Amplitude and spectrum plots can be displayed and saved.

   .. py:method:: withAdditiveNoise(original, noise, name: str = None)
      :classmethod:

      Creates a new Biosignal from 'original' with added 'noise'.

      :param original: (Biosignal) The original Biosignal to be contaminated with noise.
      :param noise: (Noise | Timeseries | Biosignal) The noise to add to the original Biosignal.
      :param name: (str) The name to associate to the resulting Biosignal.

      When 'noise' is a Noise:
          - A trench of noise, with the duration of the channel, will be generated to be added to each channel.
          - 'noise' should be configured with the same sampling frequency has the channels.

      When 'noise' is a Biosignal:
          When it has the same set of channels as 'original', sampled at the same frequency:
              - Each noisy channel will be added to the corresponding channel of 'original', in a template-wise manner.
          When it has a unique channel:
              - That noisy channel will be added to every channel of 'original', in a template-wise manner.
              - That noisy channel should have the same sampling frequency has every channel of 'original'.
          - If 'noise' has multiple segments, they are concatenated to make a hyper-template.
          - Exception: in the case where both Timeseries having the same domain, the noisy samples will be added in a
              segment-wise manner.

      When 'noise' is a Timeseries sampled at the same frequency of 'original':
          - Its samples will be added to every channel of 'original', in a template-wise manner.
          - If 'noise' has multiple segments, they are concatenated to make a hyper-template.
          - Exception: in the case where both Timeseries having the same domain, the noisy samples will be added in a
              segment-wise manner.
          - 'noise' should have been sampled at the same frequency as 'original'.

      What is "template-wise manner"?
          - If the template segment is longer than any original segment, the template segment will be trimmed accordingly.
          - If the template segment is shorter than any original segment, the template will repeated in time.
          - If the two segments are of equal length, they are added as they are.

      :return: A Biosignal with the same properties as the 'original', but with noise added to the samples of every channel.
      :rtype: Biosignal subclass


   .. py:method:: restructure_domain(time_intervals: tuple[datetimerange.DateTimeRange])

   .. py:method:: fromNoise(noises: Noise | Dict[str | BodyLocation, Noise], time_intervals: DateTimeRange | tuple[DateTimeRange], name: str = None)
      :classmethod:

      Creates a type of Biosignal from a noise source.

      :param noises:
          - If a Noise object is given, the Biosignal will have 1 channel for the specified time interval.
          - If a dictionary of Noise objects is given, the Biosignal will have multiple channels, with different
          generated samples, for the specified time interval, named after the dictionary keys.

      :param time_interval: Interval [x, y[ where x will be the initial date and time of every channel, and y will be
      the final date and time of every channel; on a union of intervals, in case a tuple is given.

.. py:class:: OverlappingTimeseries(samples: ndarray | list | tuple, initial_datetime: datetime.datetime, sampling_frequency: float, units: ltbio.biosignals.timeseries.Unit.Unit = None, name: str = None)

   Bases: :py:obj:`Timeseries`

   .. autoapi-inheritance-diagram:: ltbio.biosignals.OverlappingTimeseries
      :parts: 1

   An OverlappingTimeseries is a Timeseries that violates the rule that to each time point of its domain it must
   correspond one and only one sample. This special kind of Timeseries allows overlapping Segments, although it looses
   all its interpretational meaning in the context of being successive data points in time. This kind is useful to
   extract features from modalities or to train machine learning models.

   It inherits all properties of Timeseries and most of its behaviour.
   In order to have overlapping Segments, indexing an exact timepoint is no longer possible; Although it is legal to
   index slices. # FIXME

   .. py:property:: domain
      :type: Tuple[datetimerange.DateTimeRange]

      The intervals of date and time in which the Timeseries is defined, i.e., samples were acquired.


   .. py:property:: subdomains
      :type: Tuple[datetimerange.DateTimeRange]


   .. py:property:: duration
      :type: datetime.timedelta

      Returns real time passed from start to end, without overlaps.


   .. py:method:: append(initial_datetime: datetime.datetime, samples: ndarray | list | tuple)

      Appends a new sequence of samples in a separate Segment.
      :param initial_datetime: The date and time of the first sample in 'samples'.
      :param samples: The sequence of samples to add as a separate Segment.
      :return: None



.. py:class:: Unitless

   Bases: :py:obj:`Unit`

   .. autoapi-inheritance-diagram:: ltbio.biosignals.Unitless
