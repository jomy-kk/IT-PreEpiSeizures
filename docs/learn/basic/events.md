# Annotate with Events

A \textit{Biosignal} can also have a set of associated events (\textbf{\textit{Event}} objects). As introduced before, events are common in biosignal analysis to know when did a certain occurrence of interest happened in time, so that such segment can be processed and analysed accordingly. An \textit{Event} is an occurrence in time or within a period of time that has relevance to a specific problem. It has a name, and it must have at least an onset, an offset, or both. The onset and offset can be reset after instantiation, but the name cannot for identification stability reasons.
