Learn the Basics
=============

Hello, fellow scientist. The LongTermBiosignals, or LTBio for short, is a framework that helps us on our research through the whole lifecyle of biosignals. This comprehends their storage, annotation, processing, and analysis.

The LTBio framework has three main components:

* Python library: ``ltbio``
* Biosignal File Formal: ``biosignal``
* Biosignal Summary on the Browser

You can find the documentation of each of these components on the left sidebar.
This Chapter however is recommended to LTBio begginers, since the Framework is rather dense and it may be overwhelming at first. Worry not; at he end of this Chapter you'll be mastering it and ready to develop your own biosignal projects.
