# Package: biosignals.sources
# Description: Classes representing where from and how the biosignals were acquired. Sources can be specific sensors,
# devices, hospitals, databases, etc. and they can be composed. Each class contains a set of methods that know how to
# read and write data from that source, to extract metadata from that source, and some might also include methods to
# process the data in the specific context of that source.
