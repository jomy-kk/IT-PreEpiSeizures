        a) Periods when the standard deviation is below a certain threshold.
        b) Periods when the peak-to-peak amplitude is below a certain threshold.
        Both highly depend on the acquisition device, therefore the Biosignal should have a BiosignalSource that
        specifies any of these two thresholds as (a) EMG_REST_STD_THRESHOLD or (b) EMG_REST_PP_THRESHOLD.
        Any of these can also be overridden by passing a value as parameter.

        - Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR); the higher the better.

        - Baseline wander; the lower the better.
